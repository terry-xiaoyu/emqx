# v4.4.15

## Enhancements

- Support HAProxy protocol for dashboard API [9803](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9803).

- Added Ubuntu 22.04 package release [#9831](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9831).

- Improve the integration of the `banned` and the `delayed` feature [#9790](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9790).
  Now when publishing a delayed message will check first if its source client is banned, if true, this publish will be ignored.

- Security enhancement for retained messages [#9790](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9790).
  The retained messages will not be published if the publisher client is banned.

- Now the corresponding session will be kicked when client is banned by `clientid` [#9904](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9904).
